           Installation
-----------------------------------------------

o Installing caffe
  The code comes bundled with a version of caffe that we have modified slightly for SDS. (These
  modifications might be merged into the public caffe version sometime in the future). To install
  caffe, follow the instructions on the caffe webpage (caffe.berkeleyvision.org). Note that after
  you have made caffe, you will also need to make matcaffe.

o Installing MCG
  Download MCG (the PreTrained version should be sufficient) into extern/. You can get MCG from
  http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/mcg/. After downloading MCG
  change the root_dir in the MCG directory. Then running startup.m from the main SDS directory
  should get you started.

           Testing Pre-trained models
------------------------------------------------
Download the pretrained models from http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/shape/sds/sds_pretrained_models.tgz
and untar them in the main SDS directory. 

After that, you can run the pretrained models on any set of images using the function 
imagelist_to_sds. To see how to call that function, start with demo_sds.m

           Benchmarking and evaluation
------------------------------------------------

Benchmarking depends on two pieces of code:
